# chip8

This repository contains the source code for a chip-8 interpreter made using C and SDL2. The interpreter is still under development.

The interpreter can be run by dragging any .ch8 file into the chip8.exe file.

Alternatively, it can also be run by using the command:

`chip8 filename.ch8`

By default, the interpreter sets block drawing OFF.
The -d flag can be used to enable block drawing of sprites as demonstrated below:

`chip8 filename.ch8 -d`
